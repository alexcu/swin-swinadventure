- XML to C++ Parser: Hosted at [https://alex.paperboxstudios.net/hosted/swinadventure/](https://alex.paperboxstudios.net/hosted/swinadventure/)

## Synopsis

This game was undertaken as a project to HIT2302 Object Oriented Programming. There are three components:

- a console-based version of the game,
- a version of the game wrapped in a GUI (OS X only),
- an XML parser that allows dynamic generation of games to run in the text based adventure (see hosted link).

### SwinGame

This project makes use of the [SwinGame](http://swingame.com/) SDK.

2. If using the GUI-version, recompile from source in Xcode. Precompiled source in `./bin/`.
3. Refer to instructions at [http://bit.ly/swinadventure](http://bit.ly/swinadventure) for information regarding how to use the XML parser
